# Tree view example
In one of my test assignments, I came across a pretty interesting task. It involved creating a tree view list. While working on the test assignments, I didn’t manage to implement this. However, I’ve now spent enough time on it and created a simple example of how it could be implemented. This repo includes Vue, pure JavaScript, and React versions.
